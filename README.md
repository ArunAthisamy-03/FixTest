# FIX.com Survey Demo

## Tasks Completed

1. Separation of concerns: Implemented the tasks by creating three separate files - CSS/styles.cc, index.html, JS/script.js
2. Implemented modal overlay to display the instructions
3. Made the survey form responsive by adding bootstrap grid structure.
4. Form datas were persisted using serialization.

## Execution Order
1. Download the zip file from the mail attachment.
2. Run the index.html in the local browser.

### Challenges faced
1. Google Maps API
Since the Google MAP API is licensed, I found it difficult to get the API key. So I went with https://www.embedgooglemap.net/
